-- ============================================================
-- CPAY — 0059: reseller links, saved Lightning Address,
-- per-user cost control, and fee-based admin profit
-- ============================================================
-- Four related changes. Read the money model note at the bottom before
-- changing any of this later — the three revenue concepts here are
-- easy to conflate and mean very different things.
-- ============================================================


-- ============================================================
-- 1. Resellers (role = 'moderator') can own payment links
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Verified first: nothing actually blocked this. The RLS policies on
-- payment_links are `user_id = auth.uid()` with no role test, and
-- enforce_link_limit() reads max_payment_links off whichever profile
-- owns the row. So a reseller could already insert a link — the gap
-- was that reseller profiles were never given a link allowance, and
-- the admin panel's own creator-detail tooling only ever listed
-- role = 'creator'.
--
-- Backfilling the allowance is the only DB-side change needed. The
-- panel-side change (admin_list_creators including moderators, so you
-- can open a reseller's profile the same way) is below in section 4.
-- ============================================================
update profiles
   set max_payment_links = coalesce(max_payment_links, 5)
 where role = 'moderator'
   and max_payment_links is null;


-- ============================================================
-- 2. A saved Lightning Address for auto-withdrawals
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- A bolt11 invoice expires (typically an hour), so it can never be
-- saved once and reused — which is why Lightning has always required
-- pasting a fresh invoice per withdrawal, and why it could never be an
-- automatic payout destination.
--
-- A Lightning Address (user@domain, exactly the shape of an email) is
-- static. It resolves through LNURL-pay to a fresh invoice at payout
-- time, so it CAN be saved once in a profile and reused forever.
--
-- Stored as its own column rather than reusing one of the wallet_*
-- fields, because the validation is different and the payout path
-- treats it differently.
-- ============================================================
alter table profiles add column if not exists wallet_lightning_address text;

alter table profiles drop constraint if exists profiles_lightning_address_shape;
alter table profiles add constraint profiles_lightning_address_shape
  check (
    wallet_lightning_address is null
    or wallet_lightning_address ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$'
  );

comment on column profiles.wallet_lightning_address is
  'Static LNURL-pay address (user@domain) for automatic Lightning payouts. Unlike a bolt11 invoice this does not expire, so it can be saved once and reused.';


-- ============================================================
-- 3. Per-user cost control
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Until now the payer's markup was btcpay_shops.surcharge_percent — a
-- STORE-level BTCPay rate spread that BTCPay itself applied, which
-- CPAY could only display, never change. With one shared shop that
-- means one markup for everyone, so a freelancer could not price their
-- own work.
--
-- Confirmed against BTCPay's Greenfield API that a per-invoice rate
-- override does not exist — `checkout` carries speedPolicy,
-- paymentMethods, paymentTolerance and so on, but no rate rules. So
-- this cannot be done by asking BTCPay for a different rate per
-- invoice. CPAY changes the AMOUNT it sends instead, which is
-- equivalent from the payer's side and entirely under our control.
--
-- cost_percent is the user's own markup, on top of whatever spread the
-- shared BTCPay store already applies. Bounded by an admin-set
-- ceiling so "set your own price" cannot become "charge 400%".
-- ============================================================
alter table profiles add column if not exists cost_percent numeric(6,3) not null default 0;

alter table profiles drop constraint if exists profiles_cost_percent_range;
alter table profiles add constraint profiles_cost_percent_range
  check (cost_percent >= 0 and cost_percent <= 100);

-- The user sets their own, within the admin's ceiling. A SECURITY

-- anything money-related, and because the ceiling has to be enforced

-- ============================================================
-- The money model, written down once
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Three separate numbers, often confused:
--
-- 1. btcpay_shops.surcharge_percent — the BTCPay STORE's rate spread.
--    BTCPay applies this itself when converting USD to BTC. It covers
--    the conversion and the node's own buffer. CPAY only displays
--    it; changing it means changing it in BTCPay's own settings.
--
-- 2. profiles.cost_percent — the user's OWN markup, new here. CPAY
--    applies it by multiplying the amount before sending the invoice
--    to BTCPay. This is the freelancer or reseller pricing their own
--    work. Capped by app_settings.max_user_cost_percent.
--
-- 3. profiles.withdrawal_fee_percent — what the PLATFORM charges the
--    user, taken at payout. This, and only this, is admin profit.
--
-- A payer charged $100 on a link whose owner has cost_percent = 5
-- pays $105 worth of BTC (plus whatever spread BTCPay adds on top of
-- that). The owner is credited $105. When they withdraw $105 with a
-- withdrawal_fee_percent of 3, they receive $101.85 and the platform
-- keeps $3.15 — which is what admin_global_stats() now reports as
-- profit, rather than the old volume-times-margin guess.
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- 5. create-invoice needs the owner's cost in the lookup it already does
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- system_link_for_invoice() is the single service-role lookup that
-- create-invoice already performs before building an invoice. Adding
-- cost_percent to it means no extra round-trip, and — more
-- importantly — means the price and the store can never be read from
-- two different points in time.
--
-- Return type changes, so this needs an explicit DROP first. A plain
-- CREATE OR REPLACE against a different column list fails with 42P13,
-- and (because Supabase runs the whole migration in one transaction)
-- would roll back everything above it. That exact mistake is recorded
-- in AUDIT.md from earlier in this project.

-- allowlist — a key not on it returns nothing at all, silently. Adding
-- it here rather than leaving the hint permanently blank.

-- and every user is about to see it in their own UI anyway.
