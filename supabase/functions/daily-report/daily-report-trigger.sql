-- CPAY — daily-report cron trigger
-- ============================================================
-- This file did not exist. ledger-backup had a trigger committed;
-- daily-report's was only ever set up by hand in the dashboard, so
-- there was no record of what it sends — and when CRON_SECRET was
-- rotated, nothing in the repo showed that this job still had the
-- old value baked into it and had started returning 401 every night.
--
-- Requires the same Vault secrets as ledger-backup:
--   select vault.create_secret('<CRON_SECRET>', 'cpay_cron_secret');
--   select vault.create_secret('https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co',
--                              'cpay_functions_url');
-- ============================================================

  -- is filled in automatically by the next one.
