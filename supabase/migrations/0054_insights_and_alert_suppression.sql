-- CPAY — 0054: Creator insights, and alerts respect the hide toggle

-- 1. get_my_insights() — 7-day / 30-day revenue and conversion rate
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- New tab, new figures. Filtered by the exact same
-- small_payment_threshold() every other creator-facing figure already
-- respects (0051/0053), for one reason: a creator's own dashboard must
-- never disagree with itself. "Total earned" on Overview and "30-day
-- revenue" on Insights have to describe the same underlying set of
-- payments, or the difference reads as a bug.
--
-- Conversion rate excludes a hidden payment from BOTH sides of the
-- ratio, not just the numerator — a probe/test payment that is invisible
-- everywhere else on the dashboard should not silently drag the
-- creator's conversion rate down as an uncounted "failure" either. As
-- far as this metric is concerned, while the toggle is on, it never
-- existed.

-- 2. A read-only check the Edge Functions can call before alerting
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- "hide small settled payments" was built as a display filter for
-- creator/moderator UI, driven entirely by SQL. Telegram/Discord alerts
-- are sent from TypeScript, outside any of that — so without this,
-- turning the toggle on would still leave a Telegram channel announcing
-- exactly the payments the toggle exists to hide. This gives the
-- webhook a single, cheap thing to ask before it announces a payment:
-- "is this one small enough that the toggle should suppress it?"
