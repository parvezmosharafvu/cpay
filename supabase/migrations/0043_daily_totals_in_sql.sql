-- CPAY — 0043: One definition of "a day", computed in SQL
-- ============================================================
-- Two problems in daily-report, both of the same kind: the arithmetic
-- was being done in JavaScript over rows fetched from PostgREST.
--
-- 1. The 1000-row cap. `.select("amount_settled")` with no .range()
--    returns at most 1000 rows, and the function then summed whatever
--    it got. Any day with more than 1000 settled payments was silently
--    under-reported, with nothing to indicate it. Same bug as the
--    ledger backup, same cause.
--
-- 2. Two different days. daily-report bucketed by MIDNIGHT Dhaka, while
--    admin_daily_settled(), staff_daily_settled() and my_daily_settled()
--    all bucket by 5pm–5pm Dhaka. The archive and the screen therefore
--    disagreed about which payments belonged to which day — and because
--    nothing displays daily_stats any more, nobody would have noticed
--    until an audit compared them.
--
-- Both go away by moving the work into SQL. The database sums whole
-- tables without a row limit, and it does it from the same cycle
-- boundary the live views already use, so there is now exactly one
-- definition of a day in the system.
--
-- The half-open interval matters too: the old code used
-- `lte(day_end)` with day_end = 23:59:59.999, which drops anything
-- settling in the final millisecond. `>= start and < end` cannot.
