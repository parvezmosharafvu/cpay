-- CPAY — 0060: no ceiling on either percentage
-- ============================================================
-- Correcting two limits that were assumptions, not requirements.
--
-- They are separate numbers and always were. Stating it once more here
-- because the two have been conflated before:
--
--   cost_percent           the user's own markup on their payment
--                          links. The PAYER pays it. Set by the
--                          freelancer or reseller themselves.
--
--   withdrawal_fee_percent what the platform charges that user at
--                          payout. The USER pays it. Set by the admin,
--                          seeded from the "Default fee for new
--                          creators" setting, adjustable per profile.
--
-- Neither has a ceiling any more.
-- ============================================================


-- ============================================================
-- 1. cost_percent — the 25% admin ceiling is gone
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 0059 introduced max_user_cost_percent (default 25) on the assumption
-- that "set your own price" needed a guard rail. It does not: a user
-- pricing their own work is their own business decision, and a markup
-- that is too high simply means nobody pays their link.
--
-- The setting row is deleted rather than raised to some large number,
-- so there is no half-enforced limit left behind for someone to
-- rediscover later and wonder about.
-- ============================================================
delete from app_settings where key = 'max_user_cost_percent';

-- The CHECK is widened rather than dropped entirely. This is NOT a
-- policy ceiling — it is a typo guard. Without any bound, a fat-fingered
-- "1000" instead of "10" would charge a payer eleven times the intended
-- amount with nothing to stop it. 1000% (an 11x markup) is far beyond
-- any real pricing decision while still catching the accident.

-- 2. withdrawal_fee_percent — the 50% ceiling is gone
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- admin_update_creator_fee() has refused anything above 50% since 0014.
-- That was never asked for either; the admin sets this number and can
-- choose whatever it should be. Same typo-guard reasoning as above:
-- bounded at 100 because a withdrawal fee is a share of the amount, and
-- above 100% the payout goes negative — which is not a price, it is a
-- broken calculation. request_withdrawal() computes
-- `amount * (1 - fee/100)`, so 100% pays out exactly zero and anything
-- beyond would owe the user a negative sum.
