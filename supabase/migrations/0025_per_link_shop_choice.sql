-- CPAY — 0025: Choose a shop per link
-- ============================================================
-- Until now, creating a link named "Taylor James" made one link on
-- EVERY active shop. That is right when you want the same name offered
-- at several rates, and wrong when you want Taylor James on one shop
-- and Sophia on another.
--
-- create_link_variants now takes an optional shop. Pass one and you get
-- a single link on that shop; pass nothing and you get the old
-- behaviour, one link per active shop. Nothing that exists changes.
--
-- This is why no `$sophia` slug style was needed. A `$` prefix would
-- have had to be threaded through five separate validators (the trigger,
-- create-invoice, og-image, 404.html and the worker's looksLikeSlug
-- check), and `$` is a URL sub-delimiter that some clients percent-encode
-- to %24 — a link that works when tapped and 404s when retyped is worse
-- than no feature. Picking the shop directly gets there without touching
-- the slug alphabet at all.
-- ============================================================

-- 1. create_link_variants(name, shop)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- The old single-argument version has to go: leaving it in place would
-- give PostgREST two overloads with the same name and it would refuse
-- the call as ambiguous.
