-- CPAY — 0024: Admin link deletion + default link limit
-- ============================================================


-- ============================================================
-- 1. New creators inherit the configured link limit
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- app_settings has held 'default_max_payment_links' since 0006, and
-- the admin panel never had a field for it — but more to the point,
-- handle_new_user() never read it. Every account was created with the
-- column default of 5 no matter what that setting said.
--
-- The fee lookup right above it already worked this way; the link
-- limit was simply left out.
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- 2. Admins can delete a payment link, not only disable it
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- payments.payment_link_id is `on delete set null`, so deleting a link
-- never deletes money: the payment rows survive with their amount,
-- status and creator intact, and only lose the slug they came in on.
-- The admin panel's Transactions tab shows a dash for those.
--
-- The count is returned so the panel can warn before doing it — an
-- admin should know they are about to detach 40 payments from their
-- link, and pick "disable" instead if that is not what they meant.
