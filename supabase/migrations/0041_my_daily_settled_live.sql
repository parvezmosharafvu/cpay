-- ============================================================
-- CPAY — 0041: Creator's own daily settled, live (5pm–5pm Dhaka)
-- ============================================================
-- Same live, nothing-stored design as staff_daily_settled() (0040) and
-- admin_daily_settled() (0039), scoped to whoever is calling it. Any
-- authenticated creator may see their OWN daily settled history — no
-- is_admin()/is_moderator() check, because there is nothing to guard:
-- auth.uid() is hard-coded into the query, so a creator can never see
-- anyone else's numbers through this function no matter what argument
-- is passed, because no argument selects the creator at all.
