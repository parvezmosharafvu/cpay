-- CPAY — 0031: Stats scoped to a moderator's creators
-- ============================================================
-- A moderator assigned five creators should see the same picture an
-- admin sees, only narrowed to those five: settled totals, pending
-- payouts, withdrawn, payment counts.
--
-- admin_global_stats() cannot be reused for that — it aggregates the
-- whole platform, and a moderator must never see the platform total or
-- the admin profit figure. This is the same shape minus the profit and
-- node-balance columns, restricted by handles_creator().
--
-- An admin calling it gets every creator, so the moderator panel and
-- the admin panel can share one function.
