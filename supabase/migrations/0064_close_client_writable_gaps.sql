-- CPAY — 0064: columns a client could write that it should not
-- ============================================================
-- Three gaps, each verified against the real policies and triggers
-- before writing anything here. None is a money-movement path, which is
-- why they sat deferred — but each lets a user undo a decision the
-- system made deliberately.
--
-- The shape is the same in all three: an RLS policy that checks only
-- WHO is writing (`user_id = auth.uid()`) with no trigger checking WHAT
-- they are writing. Row ownership was never the question.
-- ============================================================


-- ============================================================
-- 1. A creator could hide their own messages from the admin
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- guard_message_updates() (0018) says so in its own comment:
--
--     -- Creators may flip read/delete flags on any message in their
--     -- thread, but may only change the text of messages they wrote
--
-- That was written before 0049 gave those flags real meaning. 0049's
-- whole design is that each side hides only from its OWN view:
-- deleted_by_creator hides from the creator, deleted_by_admin hides
-- from the admin, and neither can touch the other's copy. hide_message()
-- enforces exactly that.
--
-- But the raw UPDATE policy still let a creator set deleted_by_admin
-- directly through PostgREST, hiding a message from the admin's view —
-- the precise thing 0049 exists to prevent. read_by_admin had the same
-- problem: a creator could mark their own unread message as already
-- read by staff, burying it.

-- ============================================================
-- 2. A creator could restore a link the admin deleted, and set any cost
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- guard_link_shop_updates() (0036) guards shop_id and user_id. Two
-- columns added later are not guarded at all:
--
--   deleted_at    (0052) — clearing it un-deletes a link an admin
--                 removed. The slug was mangled on delete, so the link
--                 would come back under a mangled name rather than its
--                 original one — but it comes back, and the admin is
--                 not told.
--
--   cost_percent  (0063) — set through set_link_cost_percent(), which
--                 bounds it at 0-1000. A direct UPDATE skips that
--                 entirely, so the typo guard protecting every payer on
--                 that link could simply be stepped around.
--
-- Both are now refused from a browser session. The admin path is
-- unaffected: is_admin() short-circuits at the top, and
-- set_link_cost_percent() is SECURITY DEFINER, so it does NOT bypass
-- this trigger — it runs with auth.uid() still set to the caller. That
-- is the mistake 0061 had to fix, so the exemption is written as an
-- explicit allowance below rather than assumed.
-- ============================================================
-- Written schema-qualified with the same `set search_path to 'public'`
-- form 0036 used, so this replaces that exact function rather than
-- risking a second one under a different resolution.

-- 3. variant_group let one creator hold unlimited links
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- enforce_link_limit() counts distinct groups, not rows:

-- That is correct and intentional — create_link_variants() makes up to
-- four style spellings of one name (kebab, lower, pascal, title-kebab)
-- and they should count as the single link they are.
--
-- The gap is that nothing checked WHO a variant_group belongs to. The
-- INSERT policy is `with check (user_id = auth.uid())` and says nothing
-- about variant_group, so a creator could insert every link they wanted
-- with the same hand-picked variant_group value. Each insert then
-- counted the OTHER groups, found the same single group every time, and
-- the limit never triggered — an unlimited number of links under a
-- five-link allowance.
--
-- Fixed by capping the size of any one group at four, which is exactly
-- what create_link_variants() produces. Legitimate variants are
-- unaffected; a fifth member of a group is not a style variant of
-- anything.

-- panel was added in 0028.

-- dashboard.html and the Worker) and they have already drifted apart —
-- the DB and 404.html carry 18 entries, the Worker 11, dashboard.html
-- 10. ci/check_frontend.py now diffs all four against this function so
-- the next drift fails the build instead of going unnoticed.

-- 4b. Warn about any link that already holds a now-reserved slug
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- trg_validate_link_slug fires `before insert or update OF slug`, so it
-- only ever sees a slug being written. A row that already holds
-- 'moderator' — registered before this migration made it reserved —
-- passes through untouched.
--
-- That matters more than it looks. The Worker checks RESERVED before
-- deciding whether a path is a payment slug:
--
--     if (!looksLikeSlug || RESERVED.has(path.toLowerCase())) {
--         return fetch(request);
--     }
--
-- Once 'moderator' is on that list, /moderator serves moderator.html.
-- So an existing /moderator payment link does not merely lose its link
-- preview — it stops resolving as a payment link at all, silently, for
-- everyone the creator has already given that URL to.
--
-- Deliberately a WARNING, not an exception and not an automatic rename:
--   - an exception would abort this whole migration over one row
--   - renaming it silently would break the same URLs this is warning
--     about, just without telling anyone
-- The right call is a human's: disable it, or rename it and tell the
-- creator. A WARNING shows prominently in the Supabase SQL editor, so
-- it will not be missed the way a NOTICE can be.
