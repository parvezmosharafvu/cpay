-- CPAY — 0039: Admin daily settled + profit, live (5pm–5pm Dhaka)
-- ============================================================
-- The admin Earnings tab's "Daily settled balance history" used to
-- read from `daily_stats`, a table populated once a day by the
-- daily-report cron on a MIDNIGHT-to-midnight Dhaka boundary. That
-- gave two ways for the number on screen to be wrong at once: the
-- cron has to have actually run (a missed run left a day at $0.00,
-- which is exactly the bug that was reported and chased down
-- earlier), and even when it ran, its day boundary did not match the
-- 5pm-to-5pm cadence this project has used everywhere else — the
-- original daily-report cron, and now staff_daily_settled() (0040).
--
-- This does the same thing that fixed the moderator panel: compute
-- live, on every call, straight from `payments`. Nothing is stored,
-- nothing needs a cron, nothing can go stale. It differs from
-- staff_daily_settled() in two ways that matter for the admin view
-- specifically:
--   * one row per day across the WHOLE platform, not per creator —
--     admin's UI wants a single daily total, not a per-creator list
--   * includes admin_profit, computed with the exact formula
--     admin_global_stats() already uses, so the header stat and the
--     daily history can never quietly disagree again
--
-- ledger-backup and the daily-report cron are UNCHANGED by this — the
-- GitHub snapshot and the daily_stats table both keep working exactly
-- as before, for anything else that still reads them. This migration
-- only gives the admin panel's live view a better source to read from.
